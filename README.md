# Python greymatter Data Library (pygmdata)

Library for making a Python library to interact with greymatter Data (GM-Data).
This only works on Python 3.
Python 2.7 will NOT be supported as it is past end of life.

*NOTE* This is still very much an Alpha release and may break.
Refactoring of the Data class may be required, time to actually engineer a proper solution should be taken.

## Goals

- Stream data from GM Data instead of having to download it to the local machine
- Upload data into GM Data
- Package into PyPy
- Make docs

## Installation

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pygmdata`

## API Documentation

The API documentation is on [readthedocs](https://pygmdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
